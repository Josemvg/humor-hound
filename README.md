## **Humor Hound**

We present HumorHound, a NLP model that classifies news article titles as sarcastic or not. This project was undertaken as part of the Unstructured Data course within the Big Data Master's Degree program at Comillas ICAI University.

## **Overview**

Our project aims to develop a classifier that can accurately identify whether a news article title is sarcastic or not. We use a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection), [1] [2] which consists of news article titles labeled as sarcastic or not.

We explore various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including feature engineering, word embeddings, and transfer learning. Our goal is to identify the best approach that can help us achieve high accuracy and other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Throughout the project, we continuously monitor the performance of our models and perform error analysis to identify common mistakes.

Our final product, HumorHound, is a user-friendly web application that allows users to enter a news article title and determine whether it is sarcastic or not, using our best-performing model. We provide clear instructions on how to run the application and deploy it to a server.

We believe that our project will provide insights into the challenges of text classification and how to overcome them using various NLP techniques.
